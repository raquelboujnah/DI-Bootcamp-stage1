      <h4>A little bit about Monroe's life before her success</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Marilyn Monroe, (original name Norma Jeane Mortenson) was born in June 1 1926 in Los Angeles, California.
            During her childhood her mother was frequently confined in an asylum, and Norma Jeane was reared by 12
            successive sets of foster parents and, for a time, in an orphanage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> In 1942 she married a fellow worker in an aircraft factory, but they divorced soon after World War II. She
            strated her career by becaming a popular photographer’s model and in 1946 signed a short-term contract with
            Twentieth Century-Fox. Taking as her screen name Marilyn Monroe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The photography brought her a role in many movies and shows. With the time her fame grew steadily and
            spread throughout the world, and she became the object of unprecedented popular adulation, and that how she
            became a actress, a singer and a model</p>

      <h4>Now let's talk about the <b>real</b> Marilyn Monroe</h4>
      <p>When we think of feminist icons, Marilyn is not the first woman to come to mind. She is remembered for her
        pretty face but she was much more than that. Marilyn was an active fighter in a repressive male-dominated
        society and refused to be subjugated based on her gender.</p>
      <p>When nudes of Marilyn leaked to the public, Twentieth Century Fox instructed her to deny she was the girl.
        Marilyn Monroe refused and said she was not ashamed of it because she had done nothing wrong. “I was broke and
        needed the money,” Marilyn said. Marilyn survived the scandal and proved herself a fighter, unafraid of public
        venom. Her unapologetic response embodies the feminist token phrase: <b>My body, my choice.</b></p>
